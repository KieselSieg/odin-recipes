# odin-recipes
This project is the result of what, and *only* what, I've learned through the basics of HTML from The Odin Project. It consists of a homepage containing a list of links to some recipes I like. Hopefully, this project should attest my knowledge on HTML basics, like anchor, images, paragraphs, headings, and other elements, and proper semantics. Thank you TOP <3
